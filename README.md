## Monkey lang
Monkey lang is simple langue implemented following "Writing an interpreter in GO" by Thorsten Ball.
Even though in book the language is implemented in golang I though that doing it in ts would be more fun for me

### Features
- tokenizer
- parser (WIP)
- simple REPL

### Getting started
To run the REPL first in command line run `npm run build` and after that run `npm run start`
